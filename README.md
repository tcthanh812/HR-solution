# HR data warehouse project
In this project, I want to create a BI solution for the HR department in a company. The solution helps the HR department to easily access the required data and supports the department in reviewing the performance of employees easily. 

## 1. Get the data from the HR department. 
The HR department manages the employees using a spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, the tab [Working](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DJYTOcLgxjPA6KuPBIxC4kz67pX6i5E1KOzKzdORkYk/edit#gid=716097444) stores all the information about the employees. 

## 2. Data modelling - Conceptual level
Let's define the entities and attributes based on the data in tab Working.
